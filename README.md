# never-gonna-gif

Erica Penaflor
"Never Gonna Gif You Up" is a website created to host the Giphy API. It provides a new, 
fun look that allows users to receive data from Giphy. Users can search any phrase or 
key word and GIFs directly from Giphy will be presented. Users can also look at what 
searches or GIFs are currently trending on the Giphy website.

This website is my first of creating an API-driven website. I was able to create functions
that enabled a user to search for GIFs, select a trending search and see what GIFs will be
presented, scroll through trending GIFs, and get a feel for my creativity in the design.

The technologies used for this website were HTML, CSS, and JS (heavily used).

Ideas for future improvement:
    - creating a navbar that is modern and flexible between web and mobile apps
    - allow users to continously scroll while load item pops up at the bottom
    - including more hands-on features for users to enjoy while on the website
